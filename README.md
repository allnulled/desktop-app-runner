a) In Linux, double-click or:

```sh
./run-linux.sh
```

b) And in Windows, double-click or:

```

## Development

The app is placed in `src`.

From there, you develop in `html` but having access to all `node.js` modules from browser-side javascript.

## Advantages

It comes with a `node` and `npm` executables already, so *you do not need to download anything*.

Also, it comes with the `nw` executable too, so *you don't need to download anything else*.
